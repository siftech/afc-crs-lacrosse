For reference, also provided are the bodies of all modified functions for files modified by the diff, in the form of a map from file to function bodies. Prioritize the list of vulnerabilities by their confidence, severity, clarity, and likelihood to be exploited (most confident/severe/clear/likely should come first). Only include likely vulnerabilities that have a high probability of being exploitable â€” particularly those involving memory issues, unvalidated or unsafe input, arbitrary code execution, or potential backdoor functionality. Include issues that could be caught by one of the provided sanitizers, if applicable. Do not include speculative vulnerabilities or issues that do not exist directly in this code. Only include vulnerabilities that exist in code written in the target language."""
